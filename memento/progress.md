# Progress

*This document outlines what works, what's left to build, the current status, and known issues.*

## What Works
- Initial Memento file structure created.
- `src/utils/formSchemaParser.ts`: Utility to parse JSON schema into a normalized structure.
  - Supports `minItems`, `maxItems` for arrays.
  - Supports `ui:validationMessages` for custom error messages.
- **`DynamicForm` React Component (`src/components/DynamicForm/DynamicForm.tsx`)**:
  - Core component logic (props, state, iteration over schema).
  - Plugin system for field rendering.
  - Default field rendering plugins implemented:
    - `StringField.tsx`
    - `NumberField.tsx`
    - `BooleanField.tsx`
    - `SelectField.tsx`
    - `TextareaField.tsx`
    - `ArrayField.tsx` (with simplified item rendering).
    - Object rendering handled inline (conceptual `ObjectGroup.tsx` exists).
  - `FieldWrapper.tsx` for consistent field presentation.
  - State management for form data and errors.
  - Basic validation logic implemented in `src/components/DynamicForm/dynamicForm.utils.ts` and integrated into `DynamicForm.tsx` for submission.
  - Form submission handling.
- Example usage of `DynamicForm` in `src/App.jsx`.

## What's Left to Build
- **Flexible Layout System for `DynamicForm`**:
  - Define layout specification (e.g., `ui:layout` hints, separate layout object).
  - Design and implement layout components (e.g., `GridLayout`, `RowLayout`).
  - Update `formSchemaParser.ts` to extract layout information.
  - Integrate layout components into `DynamicForm.tsx` for field arrangement.
  - Ensure responsiveness and custom arrangement capabilities.
- **Refinements & Enhancements**:
  - **Array/Object Item Rendering**: Improve rendering for complex items within arrays and objects, including their layout.
  - **Validation for Array Items**: Implement validation logic for individual items within an array in `dynamicForm.utils.ts`.
  - **`ui:group` Support**: Formalize support for semantic field grouping, integrating with the new layout system.
  - **Advanced Validation Scenarios**: (e.g., cross-field validation, asynchronous validation - if required).
- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for `formSchemaParser.ts`.
  - Component tests for `DynamicForm.tsx` and its plugins.
- **Documentation**:
  - Detailed documentation for `DynamicForm` props, schema conventions (including layout hints), and plugin development.

## Current Status
- **Completed:** Initial implementation of `DynamicForm` with basic plugins and validation.
- **Next:** Design and implement the flexible layout system.
- **Blocked (User Action Required):** Widespread TypeScript errors related to React type definitions (`React.FC`, `React.ComponentType`, etc.) prevent compilation and testing. User needs to verify `tsconfig.json` and `@types/react` installation.

## Known Issues
- **Critical TypeScript Errors:** Project-wide errors like "Namespace '...react/index.export=' has no exported member 'ComponentType'" prevent the application from compiling. This needs to be resolved by the user by checking their React type definitions and `tsconfig.json`.
- `ArrayField.tsx` currently uses simplified rendering for object items (shows JSON string). Needs enhancement to use the `renderField` mechanism for its items.
- Validation for individual items within an array is not yet implemented.
- The `ObjectGroup.tsx` plugin is conceptual; object rendering is currently handled inline within `DynamicForm.tsx`.
