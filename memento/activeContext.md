# Active Context

*This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions and considerations.*

## Current Focus
- **Extend the DynamicForm component with a flexible layout system.**
  - Allow layout definitions in the JSON schema or via UI hints (e.g., `ui:layout`).
  - Implement layout components capable of nesting fields and groups.
  - Support responsive design principles and custom field arrangements.
  - Ensure the layout system integrates smoothly with existing field rendering and validation.

## Recent Changes
- Completed initial setup of Memento files.
- Created and refined `src/utils/formSchemaParser.ts` to normalize JSON schema.
- **Implemented the core `DynamicForm` component (`src/components/DynamicForm/DynamicForm.tsx`).**
  - Includes basic field plugins (string, number, boolean, select, textarea, array).
  - Integrated basic validation logic (`src/components/DynamicForm/dynamicForm.utils.ts`).
  - Provided an example usage in `src/App.jsx`.
  - **Note:** Critical TypeScript errors related to React type definitions are present and need user intervention (see previous `attempt_completion` feedback).

## Next Steps
- **Define Layout Specification:** Determine how layouts will be defined (e.g., `ui:layout` hints in schema, separate layout object). Consider options like grid systems, flexbox arrangements, or named layout zones.
- **Design Layout Components:**
    - Create a generic `LayoutRenderer` component or a set of predefined layout components (e.g., `GridLayout`, `RowLayout`, `ColumnLayout`).
    - Define props for these components to accept field/group definitions and layout parameters.
- **Update Schema Parser:** Modify `src/utils/formSchemaParser.ts` to extract layout definitions or hints from the JSON schema.
- **Integrate Layout System:**
    - Modify `DynamicForm.tsx` to process layout information and use the new layout components to arrange fields instead of a simple map.
    - Ensure `FieldWrapper` and individual field plugins work correctly within the new layout structure.
- **Develop Example Layouts:** Create examples demonstrating various layout configurations (e.g., multi-column, tabbed, grouped sections).
- **Address Array/Object Item Rendering:** Refine rendering for items within arrays and properties of objects, especially concerning their layout within the parent structure.
- **Implement `ui:group`:** Formalize support for `ui:group` for semantic field grouping, potentially integrating it with the new layout system.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Layout Definition Strategy:**
    - How should layouts be defined? Via `ui:layout` in the schema? A separate `layout` object passed to `DynamicForm`?
    - What level of granularity is needed? Field-level, group-level, or section-level?
- **Layout Component Design:**
    - Should we aim for a highly configurable generic layout component or a set of specific ones (e.g., `TwoColumnLayout`, `TabsLayout`)?
    - How to handle responsiveness? CSS Grid/Flexbox with Tailwind classes?
- **Integration with `ui:order`:** How will the new layout system interact with the existing `ui:order` for field sequencing?
- **Nested Layouts:** Should the system support nesting different layout components within each other?
- **Impact on `DynamicFormProps`:** What new props will `DynamicForm` need to accept for layout configuration?
