// This component might not be directly registered as a plugin in the same way as StringField, etc.
// Instead, the main DynamicForm's renderField logic will handle 'object' types by iterating
// its properties and calling renderField for each, possibly wrapping them in a div styled by this component's philosophy.

// Let's adjust DynamicForm.tsx to use this philosophy:
// When type is 'object', it will render its properties using its own renderField,
// and wrap them in a div similar to above.
// So, ObjectGroup.tsx might not be needed as a separate plugin if DynamicForm handles it.

// For now, let's keep it as a potential structural component if we want to abstract
// the grouping styling. The main `DynamicForm.tsx` already has a basic implementation
// for rendering object properties. This file could be used if that logic becomes complex.
